# Privacy policy - Ricochlime

Ricochlime is a monster shooting game developed by Adil Hanney.

## First party data collection

Ricochlime does not collect any data about you (besides the data collected by third parties, see below). All progress is stored locally on your device, including your score and monster locations on the screen.

## Third party data collection

### Google Ads

Ricochlime is free to download and play, and uses Google AdMob to display ads. AdMob may collect data about you, including your device's advertising ID, IP address, and location. You can read more about [how Google uses data from apps that use their services](https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites).

When you first open Ricochlime, you'll be shown a consent prompt asking you to choose between personalized and non-personalized ads. You can change this at any time by going to the settings menu in the game.

Note that ads are only used on the Android and iOS versions of Ricochlime:
other platforms (including the web) don't use any ads.
The FOSS (free and open-source software) version of Ricochlime for Android
distributed on F-Droid doesn't use ads either.

#### Ads policy

While Ricochlime is supported by ads, I've tried to make them as unobtrusive as possible.

At the bottom of the gameplay screen, there is a small
[banner ad](https://support.google.com/admob/answer/9993556).
To save battery and improve performance,
this ad isn't shown at all if your device is in a low-power mode.

After every game-over, you will be shown a fullscreen ad
(a "[rewarded interstitial ad](https://support.google.com/admob/answer/9884467)").
You will be shown a prompt before the ad is shown, and you can choose to skip it
for no penalty or watch it and be rewarded with some in-game coins.
